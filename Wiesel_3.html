          The depressing tale of the St. Louis is a case in point. Sixty years
          ago, its human cargo -- nearly 1,000 Jews -- was turned back to Nazi
          Germany. And that happened after the Kristallnacht, after the first
          state sponsored pogrom, with hundreds of Jewish shops destroyed,
          synagogues burned, thousands of people put in concentration camps. And
          that ship, which was already in the shores of the United States, was
          sent back. I don't understand. Roosevelt was a good man, with a heart.
          He understood those who needed help.<br /><br />
          Why didn't he allow these refugees to disembark? A thousand people --
          in America, the great country, the greatest democracy, the most
          generous of all new nations in modern history. What happened? I don't
          understand. Why the indifference, on the highest level, to the
          suffering of the victims?<br /><br />
          But then, there were human beings who were sensitive to our tragedy.
          Those non-Jews, those Christians, that we call the "Righteous
          Gentiles," whose selfless acts of heroism saved the honor of their
          faith. Why were they so few? Why was there a greater effort to save SS
          murderers after the war than to save their victims during the war? Why
          did some of America's largest corporations continue to do business
          with Hitler's Germany until 1942? It has been suggested, and it was
          documented, that the Wehrmacht could not have conducted its invasion
          of France without oil obtained from American sources. How is one to
          explain their indifference?<br /><br />
          And yet, my friends, good things have also happened in this traumatic
          century: the defeat of Nazism, the collapse of communism, the rebirth
          of Israel on its ancestral soil, the demise of apartheid, Israel's
          peace treaty with Egypt, the peace accord in Ireland. And let us
          remember the meeting, filled with drama and emotion, between Rabin and
          Arafat that you, Mr. President, convened in this very place. I was
          here and I will never forget it.<br /><br />
          And then, of course, the joint decision of the United States and NATO
          to intervene in Kosovo and save those victims, those refugees, those
          who were uprooted by a man, whom I believe that because of his crimes,
          should be charged with crimes against humanity.<br /><br />
          But this time, the world was not silent. This time, we do respond.
          This time, we intervene.<br /><br />
          Does it mean that we have learned from the past? Does it mean that
          society has changed? Has the human being become less indifferent and
          more human? Have we really learned from our experiences? Are we less
          insensitive to the plight of victims of ethnic cleansing and other
          forms of injustices in places near and far? Is today's justified
          intervention in Kosovo, led by you, Mr. President, a lasting warning
          that never again will the deportation, the terrorization of children
          and their parents, be allowed anywhere in the world? Will it
          discourage other dictators in other lands to do the <br /><br />
          What about the children? Oh, we see them on television, we read about
          them in the papers, and we do so with a broken heart. Their fate is
          always the most tragic, inevitably. When adults wage war, children
          perish. We see their faces, their eyes. Do we hear their pleas? Do we
          feel their pain, their agony? Every minute one of them dies of
          disease, violence, famine.<br /><br />
          Some of them -- so many of them -- could be saved.<br /><br />
          And so, once again, I think of the young Jewish boy from the
          Carpathian Mountains. He has accompanied the old man I have become
          throughout these years of quest and struggle. And together we walk
          towards the new millennium, carried by profound fear and extraordinary
          hope.<br /><br />Find this speech at
