          While Isaac Asimov's Cult of Ignorance" does not qualify as current,
          it is still widely cited as a sharp critique of public attitudes
          toward education and expertise. Published in the January 21, 1960
          issue of Newsweek, it appearerd as as part of Asimov’s regular column
          and addressed the growing anti-intellectualism in American society,
          warning about the dangers of valuing opinions over informed knowledge.
          "Cult of Ignorance" is one of those opinion pieces that provides
          content for editorial analysis, while also introducing an important
          message into the consciousness or subconscious of a generation who
          were raised in the age of YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, and other social
          media platforms. Carefully read Asimov's article, then according to
          your group assigned complete the following task: <br />

          It's hard to quarrel with that ancient justification of the free
          press: "America's right to know." It seems almost cruel to ask,
          ingenuously, "America's right to know what, please? Science?
          Mathematics? Economics? Foreign languages?" <br />None of those
          things, of course. In fact, one might well suppose that the popular
          feeling is that Americans are a lot better off without any of that
          tripe.<br />There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and
          there always has been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a
          constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural
          life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that "my
          ignorance is just as good as your knowledge."<br />
          Politicians have routinely striven to speak the language of
          Shakespeare and Milton as ungrammatically as possible in order to
          avoid offending their audiences by appearing to have gone to school.
          Thus, Adlai Stevenson, who incautiously allowed intelligence and
          learning and wit to peep out of his speeches, found the American
          people flocking to a Presidential candidate who invented a version of
          the English language that was all his own and that has been the
          despair of satirists ever since.<br />
          George Wallace, in his speeches, had, as one of his prime targets, the
          "pointy-headed professor," and with what a roar of approval that
          phrase was always greeted by his pointy-headed audience.<br />
          <b>BUZZWORDS:</b> Now we have a new slogan on the part of the
          obscurantists: "Don't trust the experts!" Ten years ago, it was "Don't
          trust anyone over 30." But the shouters of that slogan found that the
          inevitable alchemy of the calendar converted them to the
          untrustworthiness of the over-30, and, apparently, they determined
          never to make that mistake again. "Don't trust the experts!" is
          absolutely safe. Nothing, neither the passing of time nor exposure to
          information, will convert these shouters to experts in any subject
          that might conceivably be useful. <br />
          We have a new buzzword, too, for anyone who admires competence,
          knowledge, earning and skill, and who wishes to spread it around.
          People like that are called "elitsts." That's the funniest buzzword
          ever
