          Mr. President, Mrs. Clinton, members of Congress, Ambassador
          Holbrooke, Excellencies, friends:<br /><br />
          Fifty-four years ago to the day, a young Jewish boy from a small town
          in the Carpathian Mountains woke up, not far from Goethe's beloved
          Weimar, in a place of eternal infamy called Buchenwald. He was finally
          free, but there was no joy in his heart. He thought there never would
          be again. Liberated a day earlier by American soldiers, he remembers
          their rage at what they saw. And even if he lives to be a very old
          man, he will always be grateful to them for that rage, and also for
          their compassion. Though he did not understand their language, their
          eyes told him what he needed to know -- that they, too, would
          remember, and bear witness.<br /><br />
          And now, I stand before you, Mr. President -- Commander-in-Chief of
          the army that freed me, and tens of thousands of others -- and I am
          filled with a profound and abiding gratitude to the American people.
          "Gratitude" is a word that I cherish. Gratitude is what defines the
          humanity of the human being. And I am grateful to you, Hillary, or
          Mrs. Clinton, for what you said, and for what you are doing for
          children in the world, for the homeless, for the victims of injustice,
          the victims of destiny and society. And I thank all of you for being
          here.<br /><br />
          We are on the threshold of a new century, a new millennium. What will
          the legacy of this vanishing century be? How will it be remembered in
          the new millennium? Surely it will be judged, and judged severely, in
          both moral and metaphysical terms. These failures have cast a dark
          shadow over humanity: two World Wars, countless civil wars, the
          senseless chain of assassinations (Gandhi, the Kennedys, Martin Luther
          King, Sadat, Rabin), bloodbaths in Cambodia and Algeria, India and
          Pakistan, Ireland and Rwanda, Eritrea and Ethiopia, Sarajevo and
          Kosovo; the inhumanity in the gulag and the tragedy of Hiroshima. And,
          on a different level, of course, Auschwitz and Treblinka. So much
          violence; so much indifference.<br /><br />
          What is indifference? Etymologically, the word means "no difference."
          A strange and unnatural state in which the lines blur between light
          and darkness, dusk and dawn, crime and punishment, cruelty and
          compassion, good and evil. What are its courses and inescapable
          consequences? Is it a philosophy? Is there a philosophy of
          indifference conceivable? Can one possibly view indifference as a
          virtue? Is it necessary at times to practice it simply to keep one's
          sanity, live normally, enjoy a fine meal and a glass of wine, as the
          world around us experiences harrowing upheavals?<br /><br />
          Of course, indifference can be tempting -- more than that, seductive.
          It is so much easier to look away from victims. It is so much easier
          to avoid such rude interruptions to our work, our dreams, our hopes.
          It is, after all, awkward, troublesome, to be involved in another
          person's pain and despair. Yet, for the person who is indifferent, his
          or her neighbor are of no consequence. And, therefore, their lives are
          meaningless. Their hidden or even visible anguish is of no interest.
          Indifference reduces the Other to an abstraction.
