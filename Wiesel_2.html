          Over there, behind the black gates of Auschwitz, the most tragic of
          all prisoners were the "Muselmanner," as they were called. Wrapped in
          their torn blankets, they would sit or lie on the ground, staring
          vacantly into space, unaware of who or where they were -- strangers to
          their surroundings. They no longer felt pain, hunger, thirst. They
          feared nothing. They felt nothing. They were dead and did not know
          it.<br /><br />
          Rooted in our tradition, some of us felt that to be abandoned by
          humanity then was not the ultimate. We felt that to be abandoned by
          God was worse than to be punished by Him. Better an unjust God than an
          indifferent one. For us to be ignored by God was a harsher punishment
          than to be a victim of His anger. Man can live far from God -- not
          outside God. God is wherever we are. Even in suffering?<br /><br />
          Even in suffering. In a way, to be indifferent to that suffering is
          what makes the human being inhuman. Indifference, after all, is more
          dangerous than anger and hatred. Anger can at times be creative. One
          writes a great poem, a great symphony. One does something special for
          the sake of humanity because one is angry at the injustice that one
          witnesses. But indifference is never creative. Even hatred at times
          may elicit a response. You fight it. You denounce it. You disarm
          it.<br /><br />
          Indifference elicits no response. Indifference is not a response.
          Indifference is not a beginning; it is an end. And, therefore,
          indifference is always the friend of the enemy, for it benefits the
          aggressor -- never his victim, whose pain is magnified when he or she
          feels forgotten. The political prisoner in his cell, the hungry
          children, the homeless refugees -- not to respond to their plight, not
          to relieve their solitude by offering them a spark of hope is to exile
          them from human memory. And in denying their humanity, we betray our
          own.<br /><br />
          Indifference, then, is not only a sin, it is a punishment.<br /><br />
          And this is one of the most important lessons of this outgoing
          century's wide-ranging experiments in good and evil.<br /><br />
          In the place that I come from, society was composed of three simple
          categories: the killers, the victims, and the bystanders. During the
          darkest of times, inside the ghettoes and death camps -- and I'm glad
          that Mrs. Clinton mentioned that we are now commemorating that event,
          that period, that we are now in the Days of Remembrance -- but then,
          we felt abandoned, forgotten. All of us did.<br /><br />
          And our only miserable consolation was that we believed that Auschwitz
          and Treblinka were closely guarded secrets; that the leaders of the
          free world did not know what was going on behind those black gates and
          barbed wire; that they had no knowledge of the war against the Jews
          that Hitler's armies and their accomplices waged as part of the war
          against the Allies. If they knew, we thought, surely those leaders
          would have moved heaven and earth to intervene. They would have spoken
          out with great outrage and conviction. They would have bombed the
          railways leading to Birkenau, just the railways, just once.<br /><br />
          And now we knew, we learned, we discovered that the Pentagon knew, the
          State Department knew. And the illustrious occupant of the White House
          then, who was a great leader -- and I say it with some anguish and
          pain, because, today is exactly 54 years marking his death -- Franklin
          Delano Roosevelt died on April the 12th, 1945. So he is very much
          present to me and to us. No doubt, he was a great leader. He mobilized
          the American people and the world, going into battle, bringing
          hundreds and thousands of valiant and brave soldiers in America to
          fight fascism, to fight dictatorship, to fight Hitler. And so many of
          the young people fell in battle. And, nevertheless, his image in
          Jewish history -- I must say it -- his image in Jewish history is
          flawed.
