          invented because people who are not members of the intellectual elite
          don't know what an "elitist" or how to prounounce the word. As soon as
          someone shouts "elitist" it becomes clear that e or she is a closet
          elitist who is feeling guilty about having gone to school. <br />

          to know does not include knowledge of elitist subjects. America's
          right to know involves something we might vaguely as "what's going on"
          America has the right to know "What's going on" in the courts, in
          Congress, in the White House, in industrial councils, in the
          regulatory agencies, in labor unions--in the seats of the mighty,
          generally.<br />
          Very good, I'm for that, too. But how are you going to let people know
          all that?<br />
          Grant us a free press , and a corps of indepdendent and fearless
          investigative reporters, comes the cry, and we can be sure that the
          people will know.<br />Yes, <i>provided they can read!</i><br />As it
          happens, reading is one of those elitist subjects I have been talking
          about, and the American public, by and large, in teir distrust of
          experts and in their contempt for pointy-headed professors, can't read
          and don't read. <br />
          To be sure, the average American can sign his name more or less
          legibly, and can make out the sports headlines--but how many
          nonelitist American can, without undue difficulty read as many as a
          thousand consecutive words of small print, some of which may be
          trisyllabic? <br />Moreover, the situation in growing worse. Reading
          scores in the schools decline steadily. The highway signs, which used
          to represent elementary misreading lessons ("Go Slo," "Xroad") are
          steadily being replaced by little pictures to make them
          internationally legible and incidentally to help those who know how to
          drive a

          car but, not being pointy-headed professors, can't read.<br />Again,
          in television commericials, there are frequent printed messages. Well,
          keep your eyes on them and you'll find out that no advertiser ever
          believes that anyone but an occasional elitist can read that print. To
          ensure that more than this mandarin minority gets the message, every
          word of it is spoken out loud by the announcer.<br /><b
            >HONEST EFFORT:</b
          >
          If that is so, then how have have Americans got the right to know?
          Grant that there are certain publications that make an honest effort
          to tell the public what they should know, but ask yourselves how many
          actually read them. <br />There are 200 million Americans who have
          inhabited schoolrooms at some time in their lives and who will admit
          that they know how to read (provided you promise not to use their
          names and shame them before their neighbors), but most decent
          periodicals believe they are doing amazingly well if they have
          circulations of half a million. It may be that only 1 percent--or
          less--of Americans make a stab at exercising their right to know. And
          if they try to do anything on that basis they are quite likely to be
          accused of being elitist. <br />I contend that the slogan "America's
          right to know" is a meaningless one when we have an ignorant
          population, and that the function of a free press is virtually zero
          when hardley anyone can read.<br />What shall we do about it?<br />We
          might begin my asking ourselves whether ignorance is so wonderful
          afterall, and whether it makes sense to denounce "elitism."<br />I
          believe that every human being with a physically normal brain can
          learn a great deal and can be surprisingly intellectual. I believe
          that what we badly need is social approval of learning and social
          rewards for learning.<br />We can all be members of the intellectual
          elite and then, and only then, will a phrase like "America's right to
          know" and, indeed, any ture concept of democracy, have any meaning.
